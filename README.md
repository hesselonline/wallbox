# Wallbox Portal Component for Home Assistant

This integration is now included in homeassistant by default, please use that and not this repository. This repo is no longer maintained.
~~Home Assistant component for accessing the Wallbox Portal API.~~

~~This component consists of a sensor component, a switch to pause charging, a lock to lock the charger and a number component to set the max current.~~

~~NEW VERSION: now using the Home Assistant Integration config flow. Just add it as an integration (MyWallbox) and fill in wallbox serial, username and password. Pausing is now changed in that it is only available when charging / connected.~~

~~UPDATE 9/4/2022: rebased using the code from the builtin version; should work completely now including pausing/resuming.~~
